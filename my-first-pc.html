        <h1>My First PC</h1>
        <p>Nowadays it seems normal for young kids to start using tablets and mobile phones 
        from a very early age. They get accustomed to how these devices work and how to browse 
        the internet. I got my hands on a station pc when I was around 5 years old and even though 
        the internet had long been invented at that point, I didn't have access to it until a couple of 
        years later. It was a Dell Optiplex gx110 running the new windows 2000 with both a floppy drive and a cd drive.
        I spent ours in paint and playing ripoffs of old arcade games. It was somehow so normal at the time 
        to run into all sorts of compatability issues when install applications and you had to cross your fingers when 
        installing new games that you had the necessary drivers and good enough requirements. Thankfully, those days are over.
