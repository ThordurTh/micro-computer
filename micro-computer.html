                <h1>The First Popular Micro Computer</h1> <!-- row 1, col 1 100% -->
                <p>Featured on the cover of the magazine Popular Electronics in January 1975 was the MITS Altair 8800
                    and
                    this started the new era of the micro computer. Limited as it were, it was still widely popular -
                    though
                    mainly amongst geeks. The MITS could be purchased as a DIY project, and when is was assembled it had
                    eight switches that could be used to program it. Each switch represented one bit in the memory
                    register
                    and instructions were made one byte at a time.</p> <!-- row 2, col 1 50% -->

                    <p>As the micro computers developed and became more advanced, they would have more memory and a
                        build in
                        keyboard. They would also come with some sort of text based interface – typically a specific
                        flavour of
                        a programming language like Basic or something similar.</p>
                    <p>One of the most well known micro computers was the ZX81, which came out in 1981. This computer
                        had a wide
                        appeal even though it had no more than 1 Kb of RAM. Later extension modules became available, so
                        that
                        you could upgrade to either 16 or 64 Kb. With so much RAM you could type in 64.000 characters of
                        computer code.</p>
                    <p>The ZX81 was followed by the ZX Spectrum in 1982. This one came with 16 Kb but could be upgraded
                        to 128
                        Kb. In order to use it, one would have to connect it to a television set and the resolution
                        you’d see
                        would be 256 x 192 pixels which equals to 32 characters across in 24 lines.</p>

                <h2>How to Use a Micro Computer</h2>
                <p>The most successful micro computer by far was the Commodore 64. It had an 8 bit micro processer with
                    a
                    clock frequency at just about 1 megahertz and 64 Kb of <abbr
                        title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr>.
                    The really extraordinary thing about the C64
                    though was it’s extra graphics chip which was able to show 16 colours, 8 sprites, had scrolling
                    capabilities and a resolution of 320x200 pixels (40x25 characters) and it’s sound chip that could
                    play 8
                    octaves of sound in 3 channels. The multimedia race had begun (although no one used that word yet).
                </p>

                <img src="images/c64-back.png" alt="Commodore 64">
                <p>The C64 was a keyboard with the computer inside, like most other home computers. It did have several
                    connections on the back through witch you could connect other types of hardware like joysticks, midi
                    instruments an external storage device and a television set.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="c64-peripherals">
                <p>The C64 was a plug-and-play (no one used that word either). When you turned it on, the curser was
                    immediately blinking ready to take commands. The interface was text based and the programming
                    language
                    was Commodore Basic. Anything you wrote would be executed straight away unless you put it into a
                    program. You created programs by adding line numbers in front of your command. This program was
                    written
                    line by line (not necessarily in the right order) and stored in the computers RAM. If you turned the
                    computer off, your work would be lost unless you had stored it on an external storage device.

                <p>The computer mouse had been invented, but most people had not seen or even heard of it. So in order
                    to
                    open up a program on a Commodore 64, one would have to write directly to the screen (which was
                    effectively a prompt or a terminal): <code>LOAD “PROGRAM_NAME”,8.</code> The number would be the
                    device
                    to connect
                    with. The Commodore would respond with the following lines:
                    <code>SEARCHING FOR “PROGRAM_NAME”
                LOADING
                READY.</code>
                    The program would now be loaded into the Commodore’s memory. You could have a look at the program by
                    writing the command LIST or you could start the execution of the program with RUN.

            <p>In the time of the micro computer software were written specifically for each computer, as they all came

                their own operating system build into them. Burned into their microchips where the commands that they

                IBM PC (PC for Personal Computer) entered the market. The IBM PC used a software operating system. This
                had to load on startup, but made it easier to update - simply because you did not need to buy a
                completely new piece of hardware. The OS (for Operating System) was called MSDOS, this was short for
                <strong>Micro-Soft</strong> Disk Operating System (yes, they used a dash in their name in the early days). The code was
                based on the UNIX operating system although greatly simplified.</p>

            <h2>From Calculators to Communication Devices</h2>
            <p>Computers continued to develop. In the micro computer age the computer were mostly used as a very
                specialized machine. In many cases it was a toy used for gaming or a little bit of home programming.
                Later that changed, as the internet developed and people began to connect. In the words of Bill Gates,
                the founder of Microsoft and the developer of MSDOS:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“I think it's fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we've
                    ever created. They're tools of communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by
                    their user.”</p>
